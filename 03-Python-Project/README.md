# Python Project: UI Enrollment Data Analysis

## Overview
Analyzed University of Ibadan enrollment data (2021-2024) using Python and Pandas to identify enrollment trends and patterns.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Statistical analysis
- File I/O operations

## Dataset
- **Source:** University of Ibadan enrollment records
- **Period:** 2021-2024 academic years
- **Records:** 11,492 students across 3 years

## Key Findings
- Total enrollment: 11,492 students over 3 years
- Enrollment trend shows 4% decline from 2021 to 2024

- 2022-2023: 3,784 students
- 2023-2024: 3,775 students

## Visualizations Generated
1. **Enrollment Trend (Line Chart)** - Shows enrollment decline over time
2. **Enrollment by Year (Bar Chart)** - Compares yearly enrollment

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.14
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- OpenPyXL (Excel file handling)
